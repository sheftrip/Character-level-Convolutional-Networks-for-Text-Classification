The project is currently being written using Google's Colab. 

## Data Set

The datasets being used to train and test could not be uploaded due to the size being larger than 25 MB.
We have used two datasets:

#### Our Dataset

Prepared by us, by cleaning the unclean AG News Corpus of around 2 million news samples obtained from http://groups.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html.

#### Author's Dataset

Prepared by one of the authors of the paper "Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification", Xiang Zhang.
We obtained this dataset from his personal website: http://xzh.me/
